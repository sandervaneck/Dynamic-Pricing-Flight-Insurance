# Flight Refund Prediction

This repository contains a Python script for predicting flight refunds using machine learning models. The script loads weather and flight data, performs feature engineering, trains various classifiers, and tunes the models using Optuna to find the best hyperparameters.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.7+ and the following libraries installed:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `optuna`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib`
- `statsmodels`
- `openpyxl`
- `imbalanced-learn`

You can install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project Structure

- **constants/paths.py**: Contains file paths for the weather data.
- **dataHandling/addCatScores.py**: Functions to add categorical scores to the data.
- **dataHandling/createdf.py**: Functions to parse and create the main dataframe.
- **evaluations/crossvalidation.py**: Functions for cross-validation of models.
- **evaluations/feature_importances.py**: Functions to compute and plot feature importances.
- **resample.py**: Functions for data resampling.
- **tuning/objective.py**: Contains the objective function for Optuna optimization.

## Data Preprocessing

The script starts by loading weather and flight data from the specified paths and cleaning the data. Categorical scores are then added to the data, followed by feature engineering to create additional interaction terms, such as `wind_precip` and `visibility_squared`.

```python
df = parse_data(summarized_data, weather_paths, weathers)
df = add_cat_scores(df, file2, wb2)
df['wind_precip'] = df['windspeed'] * df['precip']
df['visibility_squared'] = df['visibility'] * df['visibility']
```

## Feature Engineering

The script creates several interaction terms that combine weather features to capture non-linear relationships:

- `wind_precip`: Interaction between windspeed and precipitation.
- `visibility_squared`: Squared visibility to capture non-linear effects.

These features are then used in model training.

## Model Training

Several machine learning models are trained:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)
- Generalized Linear Models (GLM)

The training data is split into train, validation, and test sets using an 80-10-10 split. Each model is trained on the training set, and feature importance is evaluated.

```python
train_X, train_X_nonlinear, train_Y = ... # Prepared feature sets
logistic_regression = LogisticRegression(random_state=seed)
rand_clf = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=5)
svm_clf = SVC(random_state=seed)
gbm = GradientBoostingClassifier(random_state=seed)
```

## Model Tuning

Hyperparameter tuning is performed using Optuna to find the optimal model configuration.

```python
study = optuna.create_study(direction="maximize")
study.optimize(objective, n_trials=100)
best_params = study.best_trial.params
```

## Evaluation

The models are evaluated using cross-validation with metrics such as F1 score, precision, recall, accuracy, and specificity.

```python
crossvalscore(logistic_regression, train_X, train_Y, 'logistic_regression')
crossvalscore(rand_clf, train_X, train_Y, 'rand_clf')
```

## Visualization

The script generates several plots:

- Correlation matrix of the features.
- Observed vs. predicted outcomes over time.
- Feature importances for the best model.

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
sns.heatmap(corr_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', vmin=-1, vmax=1)
plt.show()

plt.plot(test_Y['date'], test_Y['refund'], label='Observed Outcomes')
plt.plot(test_Y['date'], predicted_outcomes, label='Predicted Outcomes', linestyle='dashed')
plt.show()
```

## Usage

To run the script, execute the following command:

```bash
python script.py
```

The script will load the data, train the models, tune the hyperparameters, and save the results to an Excel file and image files.
